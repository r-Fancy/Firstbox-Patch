**Extra Mention**

**Strict Weapon order**
> "iw5_rhinozm", "npc_rhino_base_static_holo", &"ZOMBIES_RHINO", "none", "none", "none", undefined, 1 - First
> 
> "dna_aoe_grenade_zombie", "npc_exo_launcher_grenade_holo", &"ZOMBIES_DNA_AOE", "none", "none", "none", 2, 2 -  Second
> 
> "iw5_mahemzm", "npc_mahem_base_holo", &"ZOMBIES_MAHEM", "none", "none", "none", undefined, 3 - Third

**Coop**

Because the weapons are given in a strict order, everyone can only get their setup one by one. That means Player 1 has to get his weapons (setup) first before the next player can get his setup

**Weapon Limit**

Some Weapons have a limit - WHICH IS NOT ALLOWED TO BE CHANGED. You know there's a limit when at the end it says 2 (means only 2 people can hold it). For Special Grenade that means 2 Nanos and 2 Drones are avaible

**undefined**

undefined tag can be understood just like "none". Use it when the weapons doesn't have a limit. 
example:
> "iw5_rhinozm", "npc_rhino_base_static_holo", &"ZOMBIES_RHINO", "none", "none", "none", undefined, 1
> 
> "iw5_fusionzm", "npc_fusion_shotgun_base_holo", &"ZOMBIES_FUSION_RIFLE", "none", "none", "none", 2, 2
